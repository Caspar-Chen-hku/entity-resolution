In the leading role of Celie, Whoopi Goldberg offers an exuberantly simple performance, a quiet bloom of naivete and hurt and tenderness. Goldberg&apos;s performance is raw and mostly silent, unimpaired by her later comedic shticks and vocal tics. Goldberg&apos;s Celie blazes with human emotion, a carefully crafted portrait of an abandoned child staggering and stumbling on her way to confident womanhood. Goldberg&apos;s work in the picture provides a startling reminder a fleeting moment when Goldberg&apos;s gifts as an actress were unfettered by the ossifying effects of her celebrity persona. The same can -- even more emphatically -- be said for...", "Based on Alice Walker&apos;s acclaimed novel, The Color Purple tells the story of Celie, a variously abused young African American woman living in the American South at the beginning of the 20th century. As she works and works, Celie&apos;s reminded at every turn, and by everyone, that she&apos;s ugly and black and poor and a woman and thus worth nothing. With a grand flourish, the film charts Celie&apos;s slow and steady journey toward a conscious, empowered womanhood and Celie quietly emerges as the de facto matriarch of a family of women. Most of these women dismissed or disregarded Miss Celie upon their first acquaintance, but the beauty of the story flows from how Miss Celie nonetheless learns from each of them a lesson of womanist strength."], "triple": ["The Color Purple", "tell the story of", "celie"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": null, "subject": null}, "_id": 32153}

It is an encapsulated immotile aerobe that does not make spores. Bordetella pertussis produces a number of virulence factors, including pertussis toxin, adenylate cyclase toxin, filamentous hemagglutinin, and hemolysin. It cannot survive in the environment; it must reside in a host either in small groups or singly. It grows at an optimal temperature of 35-37\ufffdC. [1]", "Bordetella pertussis has several virulence factors, one of which is the adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA). It is the agent that causes whooping cough. CyaA invades eukaryotic cells by a calcium-dependent mechanism in which the CyaA catalytic domain is directly moved across the target cells plasma membrane. CyaA contains a series of a Gly-and Asp-rich nonapeptide repeats of the prototype GGXG(N/D)DX(L/I/F)X (where X can be any amino acid). This prototype is a characteristic of the repeat in toxin for the bacterial cytolysins family.[2] Another major virulence factor that is secreted by Bordetella pertussis is the pertussis toxin (PT). Pertussis toxin ADP ribosylates mammalian G(i) proteins and is a key component in the early stages of the respiratory infection. PT targets respiratory tract macrophages in promoting the infection. [5] Furthermore, like any infection, attachment to epithelial cells is a major factor in colonization. The filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) is the virulence factor mediating adhesion to host cells.

In &quot;Pertussis Hospitalizations Among Infants in the United States, 1993-2004,&quot; researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention examined hospitalization discharge databases and national disease surveillance data to describe recent rates of pertussis hospitalization among infants. Rates peaked for infants 1 month of age at 260 hospitalizations per 100,000 live births. By 3 months of age, the rate dropped to 103 hospitalizations per 100,000 live births, a 60 percent decline. The first dose of diphtheria/tetanus/acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine is recommended at 2 months of age. These data suggest even one dose of DTaP vaccine provides protection against hospitalization with pertussis. The authors suggest new vaccination strategies should be evaluated to protect infants as early in life as possible.

He worked so steadily that De Corpore was first printed in 1654. Also 1654 a small treatise, Of Liberty and Necessity was published by Bishop John Bramhall addressed at Hobbes. Bramhall, a strong Arminian, had met and debated with Hobbes and afterwards wrote down his views and sent them privately to be answered in this form by Hobbes. Hobbes duly replied, but not for publication. But a French acquaintance took a copy of the reply and published it with &quot;an extravagantly laudatory epistle&quot;. Bramhall countered in 1655, when he printed everything that had passed between them (under the title of A Defence of the True Liberty of Human Actions from Antecedent or Extrinsic Necessity). In 1656 Hobbes was ready with his Questions concerning Liberty, Necessity and Chance, in which he replied &quot;with astonishing force&quot; to the bishop. As perhaps the first clear exposition of the psychological doctrine of determinism, Hobbes&apos;s own two pieces were important in the history of the free-will controversy. The bishop returned to the charge in 1658 with Castigations of Mr Hobbes&apos;s Animadversions, and also included a bulky appendix entitled The Catching of Leviathan the Great Whale. Hobbes never took any notice of the Castigations.", "Beyond the spat with Bramhall, Hobbes was caught in a series of conflicts from the time of publishing his De Corpore in 1655. In Leviathan he had assailed the system of the original universities. In 1654 Seth Ward (1617-1689), the Savilian professor of astronomy, replying in his Vindiciae academiarum to the assaults by Hobbes and others (especially John Webster) on the academic system. Errors in De Corpore, especially in the mathematical sections, opened Hobbes to criticism from John Wallis, Savilian professor of geometry. Wallis&apos;s Elenchus geomeiriae Hobbianae, published in 1655 contained an elaborate criticism of Hobbes&apos;s whole attempt to put the foundations of mathematical science in its place within the general body of reasoned knowledge - a criticism which exposed the utter inadequacy of Hobbes&apos;s mathematics. Hobbes&apos;s lack of rigour meant that he spent himself in vain attempts to solve the impossible problems that often waylaid self-sufficient beginners, his interest was limited to geometry and he never had any notion of the full scope of mathematical science. He was unable to work out with any consistency the few original thoughts he had, and thus was an easy target. Hobbes took care to remove some of the worst mistakes exposed by Wallis, before allowing an English translation of the De Corpore to appear in 1656. But he still attacked Wallis in a series of Six Lessons to the Professors of Mathematics in 1656."], "triple": ["Bramhall", "counter in", "1655"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "1655", "subject": "Bramhall"}, "_id": 7006}

But all of our journalism and our media increasingly are pitched along the class divide of our society. So that if you take newspapers as a great example, in the 1940s, every major daily newspaper had at least one or two labor reporters or editors. There were over a thousand in the country. Take something like the 1937 sit-down strike in Flint, which established the UAW. In a sane world it would be a national holiday. It&apos;s one of the decisive moments in the twentieth century. It was a front-page story in every newspaper in the country. Even the Chicago Tribune, which despised labor, covered it. At dinner tables around the country people talked about the strike every night. \u00a0 Today, you know how many full-time labor reporters we have? Three. From a thousand to three. At the same time the number of business reporters has increased so exponentially that I don&apos;t even think they call them business reporters any more. They&apos;re merged. Like cable TV news today, if you watch the Fox news channel, or CNBC or CNN, business news and news are almost interchangeable now. CNN&apos;s flagship news program is called Moneyline. It&apos;s entirely geared towards the markets that advertisers are interested in, which is the upper middle class. Newspapers have written off the bottom thirty or forty percent of the populations in their markets. They don&apos;t even sell the papers oftentimes in poor neighborhoods. So what you get is news basically aimed at the needs, prejudices of fairly well-to-do and affluent people. Even then I think they do a fairly poor job of it, but that&apos;s what it&apos;s aimed at. For the rest of the population, it&apos;s, You&apos;re not invited. 2 Another change that Rogers may have noted is how few newspapers there are. New York once had seven major dailies. Now it&apos;s down to three. In Houston and lots of other cities around the country there is only one paper. \u00a0 New York is the exception. There are only a handful of cities with competing dailies with different owners, where they don&apos;t have some sort of cartel agreement. Something like 95% of American communities are one-newspaper towns. What these newspaper companies have discovered is that they can make a fortune in these monopolistic communities by low-balling journalism, by stripping down the piece for parts and using lots of syndicated material and fluffing it up. The profits go off the charts. In 1985 Gannett, one of the big chains, bought the Des Moines Register, historically one of the great American newspapers. The Register at that time had a full-time reporter in every county in Iowa, so wherever you lived you could follow state politics. Gannett, which owns a hundred monopoly newspapers around the country, said: &quot;What are these jokers doing for the bottom line?&quot; and fired them all. They shifted the coverage to focus on the wealthy suburbs of Des Moines and the business community. Their profits shot up. Their costs went down. They run syndicated material, comics and wire service articles. But the citizens of Des Moines, of Iowa, lost out. There&apos;s no coverage of their state. And given newspaper economics, and media economics at large, it&apos;s not a competitive market. No one can start a newspaper and hope to compete. Once you&apos;ve got a monopoly in newspapers, you&apos;ve got it forever. 3 What was that famous line attributed to A.J. Liebling? &quot;Freedom of the press is ...&quot; \u00a0 &quot;... for those who own them.&quot; That&apos;s the truth constitutionally. We talk about the First Amendment, invoking it constantly. That&apos;s what Liebling was referring to there, the idea that we&apos;re protected from government interference in matters of the press and free speech. It&apos;s a wonderful idea, a wonderful freedom, one of the great things about this country&apos;s history and the struggle to bring that into being. But a funny thing happened along the way with the First Amendment and freedom of the press. When it was passed, the owner and the editor were the same person. There were largely competitive markets. If you didn&apos;t like what was being done, you could start your own paper, own it and edit it. That was the way newspapers were for the first hundred years of this country&apos;s history. But we had a big split take place a hundred years ago that separated owners from the editors and reporters who actually do the creative work. Moreover, the ownership is in the corporate form, which is blind shareholders who own stock in media companies and oil wells or gold mines or automobile companies. Whose First Amendment is it then? Our tradition has been to say it stays with the owners, not the editors or reporters. So editors have no First Amendment freedom, just the owners. It&apos;s rarely commented upon, but it&apos;s been a real shift in the First Amendment and one with disastrous implications for the caliber of journalism and our whole political culture. 4 You make an urgent connection between media and democracy. Why? \u00a0 This is nothing original. This goes back to the Founding Fathers, even before that. If you have a notion of democracy, which is: the many rule. Obviously you can&apos;t have a plebiscite on every decision. That&apos;s not going to happen. But people in representative democracies can make the fundamental value decisions and elect people to implement them. That&apos;s what we can hope for. To have that be effective and viable, you need some sort of media system that&apos;s going to do two things. First of all, it&apos;s going to ruthlessly account for the activities of people in power and people who want to be in power so you know what they&apos;re actually doing. Secondly, it&apos;s going to give a wide range of opinions on the fundamental social and political issues that citizens need to know about. It doesn&apos;t mean that each medium has to do that, but the system as a whole has to provide that as an easy alternative for people who want to participate as citizens. That&apos;s the test of a media system in a democracy. That&apos;s the test we should apply to it. By that standard, our current media system is a fiasco. It&apos;s a system set up fundamentally to serve the shareholders and a dozen or so massive companies and their major advertisers. It does that quite well. But it works more often than not directly against what&apos;s necessary for a democratic society. \u00a0 We&apos;re such a commercially marinated society that our notion of speech to fellow citizens to bring truth through discussion and interaction has been pushed to the margins. Now the whole idea of speech is to make money. So whether something&apos;s true or false is irrelevant. If they buy you&apos;re product, that&apos;s the truth. If they believe your lie, that&apos;s good enough. You get from them what you want. Completely lost in the dominant culture is the genuine notion of truth, a sense of how it comes as a result of dialogue and interaction and exchange. I think we have to get back to that, and our media system isn&apos;t going to get us there. It&apos;s part of the problem. It&apos;s Madison Avenue and Wall Street&apos;s media system. 5 There&apos;s been a huge explosion of &quot;trash media.&quot; What accounts for it? \u00a0 The conventional wisdom is that it&apos;s demand-driven, that the audience is demanding more stories about JonBenet and O.J. and car crashes and JFK Jr. There&apos;s a element of truth about that, to the extent that if you&apos;re fed a steady diet of something, eventually you&apos;re going to demand it. It&apos;s a given. But the real motor force behind it isn&apos;t demand. It&apos;s supply driven. The reason why this sort of journalism dominates is that it&apos;s extremely inexpensive to do. It&apos;s extremely non-controversial to anyone in power. It&apos;s ideal fill space. It will attract an audience. It doesn&apos;t take skilled journalists. You can have low-ball, low-budget journalists. Compare it to what real journalism would do. Take the same reporters covering the JonBenet case and have them examine toxic waste dumps in the U.S. Take all that human labor and money into that. The same money would probably cover a lot fewer stories, because it takes a long time to do and it takes six months to break a story. The story might not even pan out. That&apos;s one of the risks you have. Then if it does pan out you&apos;re going to get some very powerful corporate and governmental interests pissed off at you. That&apos;s the last thing these corporate media giants want to do. That&apos;s something they try to avoid like the plague. So you just aren&apos;t going to see that. You never have to worry about the JonBenet story pissing off the head of a bank. So I say it&apos;s supply driven. It&apos;s very profitable. People consume it and they say: &quot;People are really interested in this.&quot; The O.J. trial. Even I was interested in whether Kato Kalin was going to get a job after a year of this. You get exposed to enough of it and it becomes a sort of soap opera. But I would have loved to have the opportunity to be exposed to some real journalism that engaged the major issues of the day. 6 The corporate media managers, the conservative critics of your argument, will say: &quot;Look, that&apos;s fine. We are giving the public what it wants. The proof of that is that they can vote with their remote. They can just click off that Seinfeld rerun if they don&apos;t want to watch it. No one is force-feeding them.&quot; \u00a0 That&apos;s one of the big arguments I try to deal with in Rich Media, Poor Democracy, the idea that the system is giving the people what they want. There are a lot of layers to answer that because it&apos;s such an important argument. And there&apos;s an element of truth to it. If there wasn&apos;t, it wouldn&apos;t be a strong argument. No one puts a gun at your head and says you have to watch this or that. You can switch channels. The problem with it is first of all go back to what I just talked about. The relationship of supply and demand isn&apos;t one of obedient media giants giving you whatever you bark out your command for. It&apos;s a complex interactive relationship. Let me give you one example of how that works. In the mid-1970s, ten percent of the films exhibited in theaters were foreign films, made outside the U.S. In the mid-1980s it was down to six or seven percent. Today it&apos;s one-quarter of one percent: .025%. It&apos;s non-existent, in other words, except for maybe an occasional film. In the traditional give-the-people-what-they-want theory, this would mean that some time in the last twenty years the American people resoundingly smashed their fists on the table and said: &quot;Get these foreign films out of our theaters.&quot; We hate them. We refuse to go to them. But that&apos;s not what happened at all. It was the direct opposite. Starting in the mid-1970s, you saw the end of the single-screen theater as the main form of distribution. So single-screen theaters were replaced by multiplexes. One multiplex with eight to twelve screens. One camera person operates all twelve screens. One popcorn crew operates all twelve screens. It&apos;s basically impossible to survive with a single-screen theater any more. \u00a0 All the foreign films were coming into single-screen theaters. So there were two dozen foreign film theaters in Manhattan alone in the 1970s. Today I think there&apos;s one, if that. Cities like Seattle, where I lived, had six. Even in small towns like Yellow Springs, Ohio there were a couple. It was commonplace. But those sorts of theaters couldn&apos;t survive. They were replaced by these multiplexes. So then when a French or Japanese filmmaker came to the U.S. and wanted to screen a film, the multiplexes said: &quot;You have to be in all 215 multiplexes, and you have to pay a marketing budget equivalent to what a Hollywood studio spends to buy those big ads that you have to run the weekend before you come out.&quot; The amount of money was prohibitive for them, several times more than they paid to make the film. Over time they stopped being carried. As a result today, I ask my students: &quot;How many of you watch foreign films?&quot; Most of them don&apos;t even know they exist. They make films in Germany? Really? They aren&apos;t going to ask for them in the video store, so there&apos;s no demand for them, but it&apos;s not that people don&apos;t want them. They don&apos;t have a chance to be exposed to them. That illustrates how complex this relationship is. The idea that you have a vote is nonsense. \u00a0 Take cable TV. You have a choice. What is your choice? The fifty largest commercially viable cable television channels are basically owned part or outright by these eight or nine largest media companies. Time Warner, Disney, News Corporation, CBS, Viacom, TCI, now AT&amp;T, General Electric, NBC, Sony. They basically own all the five or six commercial proven genres that they all ape each other with. It&apos;s not like you have fifty distinct channels. Everybody&apos;s got their business news service. They&apos;ve got their commercial kids channel which bombards kids with ads around the clock. You&apos;ve got your sports channels, music video channels. There&apos;s a handful of genres. If you don&apos;t like it, what choice is there beyond that if you want to watch TV? You don&apos;t really have a whole lot of choice. You&apos;re going to get one of their channels, and they&apos;re all imitating each other. That&apos;s another thing about the market. It&apos;s actually ironic, given all the claims made about it. It&apos;s a very poor mechanism for creativity. Look at popular music. These record companies are constantly desperate to make money. So they want to give people what they want, the five companies that sell 90% of the music now, all but one part of these huge giants we just named. The problem they have is that the commercial impulse isn&apos;t always very good for creativity. All the great breakthroughs in rock and roll and popular music in the last forty years have been outside of their web. It happens in the nooks and crevices. Once these corporate guys get hold of it, they try to recreate it. They do marketing surveys, demographics and focus groups. They come up with something that&apos;s lost all the creative spark. It&apos;s pathetic. They just can&apos;t do it, and it gets worse and worse, not better and better. It&apos;s built into the process, in fact the commercial marketplace arguably is anti-creative. Real creativity can&apos;t be sparked on Wall Street. 7 Talk about the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which was very strongly pushed by Bill Clinton and Al Gore. \u00a0 And the entire political establishment. The Republicans are in bed with them. 8 The logic that was promoted then was that the passage of this act would usher in a new era of diversity. It would foster competition. We&apos;ve had a few years now to look at the record. What does it look like? \u00a0 There&apos;s a myth going around that capitalism is based on competition. Have you heard that one? That&apos;s one they feed us here at the lower levels. The Act ushered in the greatest wave of corporate concentration and the greatest attack on competitive markets arguably in the history of U.S. capitalism. It&apos;s done the exact opposite of what the PR people said would happen. The corporate lobbyists that rammed this law through, paid for it and bought off members of Congress to support it, knew this would happen. They would never have put this through if they thought it would lead to competition. They were ramming it through to make sure it would give them all the tools to prevent there being competition. The outcome actually is exactly what the real people behind it wanted. We started in 1996. Look at telecommunications. We had AT&amp;T, Sprint, MCI, the long-distance companies, GTE, and the seven Baby Bells. We had eleven companies. Now we are down to four after mergers and acquisitions. Look at the media, radio, for example. The deregulation of ownership in radio has been astonishing. We&apos;ve seen over half the stations sold. It used to be you could only own twelve or fourteen stations nationally. Now you can have as many as you want, up to eight in the largest markets. There&apos;s been an unbelievable consolidation of ownership, with disastrous implications for the content of radio as it&apos;s been regimented and homogenized. All the localism and creativity have been stripped out. But the profits are going through the roof, which was exactly what was meant to happen. 9 Ralph Nader reports that when the legislation was being drafted, the lobbyists for the big telecom corporations were actually in the Congressional committee rooms helping the representatives of the people draft the legislation. \u00a0 It was a classic case. The lobbyists wrote chunks of it. This really shows how politics works. There were intense fights among these various lobbying groups, the satellite broadcasters, terrestrial broadcasters, cable companies, long-distance companies and local Baby Bells, about who was going to get the biggest slice of the pie, the best terms of the law. But there was one thing they all agreed on, which was, it was their pie. No one else should know about it. They would keep it to themselves. They were fighting each other incessantly for five years. In 1996, three weeks before it passed, all the conventional wisdom was saying it wouldn&apos;t get through, that it would take another year or two to pass because there were such big fights. They all buried the hatchet, because they wanted to get it out of Congress&apos;s hands. They were afraid the general public might learn about it and weigh in on it, particularly with someone like Ross Perot running for President again. They saw what a monkey wrench he threw into their plans for NAFTA in 1992 and they didn&apos;t want to see it again. 10 Let&apos;s talk about the Internet and its initial public subsidy. Its origins were rooted in a Pentagon-funded project called the Advanced Research Projects Agency, Arpanet. At what point does the Internet pass into the private sector? Did I miss that debate? \u00a0 You might have blinked at that moment. There was no coverage of it whatsoever. The Telecom Act of 1996 was probably the final word on the subject that passed all control over to the private sector. There was zero debate. It&apos;s a classic case of how politics works short of having popular movements that challenge corporate power. The Internet was founded in the 1960s and 1970s not just for the military, but for researchers to communicate through their computers. It made no sense to the private sector. It&apos;s a real testament to socialism, or to public-sector investment. There was no way you could make money off this thing for twenty years. The story goes that in the 1970s the government went to AT&amp;T and said: &quot;Will you take this thing over? It&apos;s costing us a lot of money.&quot; AT&amp;T looked at it and said: &quot;We can&apos;t make any money off this. You keep it.&quot; Bill Gates had nothing to do with the Internet. He is the most overrated person, as an aside. People think he&apos;s so rich he must be a genius. He&apos;s better than us. He has better sex. He&apos;s funnier. He&apos;s handsomer. He&apos;s the Ringo Starr and Jed Clampett of the Information Age. He&apos;s sitting on this monopoly. Anyone with a $100 billion monopoly is going to have people kissing up to him.

Donald Trump is known for real estate. I am sure that they have other things that they focus on now but they are known as being experts in a certain field. What do you focus on? Many things or one thing? I am willing to bet that if your answer is many you are in a state of Internet marketing disconbobulation. Find something you like doing and become an expert at it.

History Flatbreads or rounds of dough with various toppings can be found throughout the history of civilization. What is known as pizza today can be traced to Naples, Italy in the Middle Ages. The Italians are also credited with coining the term pizza, although its origin is not clear. It could have derived from the Italian word for point, pizziare, meaning to pinch or pluck, or a verb meaning to sting or to season. Early toppings may have included cheeses, dates, herbs, olive oil, and honey. Tomatoes or tomato sauce were not introduced until the sixteenth century when New World explorers brought the red fruit back from South America. The wealthy classes regarded the tomato as a fruit to be avoided; indeed many thought it to be poisonous. But in the peasant neighborhoods of Naples, residents were enjoying it with the rounds of dough that constituted their primary staple. Somehow the news of this tomato pie spread, and open-air pizza parlors began to do a brisk business. It was also not unusual to see the pizza marker, or pizzaioli plying his wares through the streets. Just as the tomato made its way to Europe, the pizza traveled to the United States with the large influx of Italian immigrants in the latter part of the nineteenth century. One of the earliest known pizzerias was opened by Gennaro Lombardi in New York City in 1905. The thin-crust pie served featured a layer of tomato puree, mozzarella cheese, and various toppings such as sausage and pepperoni. In 1943, Ike Sewell created a deep-dish version at his Chicago restaurant, Pizzeria Uno. The deep-dish pizza combines the sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, and such with the cheese, which is then poured into a high-sided crust. A layer of tomato sauce is then ladled over the top. By the end of the 1940s, Frank A. Fiorello was packaging and marketing the first commercial pizza mix. Frozen pizzas were introduced in 1957. By the 1990s, one out of every 20 meals eaten American homes each week was pizza. From its humble beginnings as a staple of the peasant diet, pizzas now sport everything from shrimp to pineapples to barbecued chicken. The manufacturing process, however, remains virtually the same. Raw Materials Flour is ground from grain. All grains are composed of three parts: bran (the hard outer layer), germ (the reproductive component), and endosperm (the soft inner core). All three parts are ground together to make whole wheat flour. To make white flour, the bran and the germ must be removed. Since bran and germ contain much of the nutrients in grain, the white flour is often &quot;enriched&quot; with vitamins and minerals. Some white flour has also been fortified with fiber and calcium. Yeast is a single-celled fungus. The variety Sacchromycetais cerevisae is cultivated for use in fermentation to produce alcoholic beverages and bread. Yeast enzymes allow its cells to extract oxygen from the "], "triple": ["Pizza", "be eat throughout", "italy"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": null, "subject": null}, "_id": 4661}

If you love pizza like Slice does, this is a great backgrounder on this royally great food. WORDS BY ED LEVINE The pizza police, dedicated to the proposition that authenticity is everything, tell us that you cannot judge or taste pizza properly without having eaten it in Naples. Pizza wasn&apos;t invented in Naples (there have been flatbreads with toppings for thousands of years), but it is the place where pizza became popular, and where this perfect, simple food burrowed itself deep into the consciousness of Neapolitans of every class and neighborhood. Naples, they say, is where the modern pizza-eating rituals first flowered. In 1830, the world&apos;s first pizzeria, Antica Pizzeria Port&apos;Alba, opened its doors in Naples, and an industry was born. Antica Pizzeria Port&apos;Alba is still in business, by the way. Fifty-nine years later, a pizzaiolo named Raffaele Esposito was invited to the Italian royal palace to make three pizzas for the visit of King Umberto and Queen Margherita of Savoy. The queen was apparently no dummy when it came to politics, so she declared her favorite pizza to be the one with the colors of the Italian flag: red (tomato), white (mozzarella cheese), and green (basil). Thus, pizza Margherita was born. Right around the time Esposito came up with the Margherita, Italians started coming to America by the millions, driven by the prospect of improving their standard of living. According to author Pamela Sheldon Johns, five million Italians made their way to America by the turn of the twentieth century, 80 percent of them from the south of Italy. Thus it was almost inevitable that a Neapolitan immigrant named Gennaro Lombardi would open the first pizzeria in America - Lombardi&apos;s on Spring Street in lower Manhattan in 1905.", "Every food writer and historian worth his or her pizza crust has made the pilgrimage to Naples to taste pizza at the source. When I went, I was armed with clippings from many of the illustrious &quot;foodies&quot; who had gone before me - David Downie, Alan Richman, and Jeffrey Steingarten. To bolster my credibility and to guide me through that stunningly beautiful city, I persuaded Maurizio DeRosa to come with me. Maurizio is a Neapolitan native and the former owner (along with his mother and brother) of the now-defunct DeRosa, the only Neapolitan restaurant ever given three stars by Ruth Reichl during her stint as restaurant critic for the New York Times. We stayed at his mother&apos;s in the Vomero section of Naples and set out to eat at the 15 best pizzerias in the city. I actually would have gone to more, but Maurizio assured me that 15 pizzerias in five days would be his limit. What did we find? Well, I hope Maurizio doesn&apos;t banish me from Italy for saying this, but what I found is that the Neapolitan culture of pizza is in many ways more interesting than the pizza itself. PIZZA PILGRIMAGE As the plane touched down in Rome, I had a disturbing thought: What if Neapolitan pizza wasn&apos;t as good as the pizza I most love in the States: Chris Bianco&apos;s and Totonno&apos;s and Sally&apos;s and Pepe&apos;s in New Haven? What if I showed my true provincial food colors once again? How could I face my purist foodie brethren, who claim that food is always best eaten in its place of origin? How could I face my Naples host, Maurizio DeRosa, who is an unabashed Neapolitan pizza champion, the keeper of the wood-burning flame as it were? He had graciously offered to take me to Naples on a pizza-eating expedition or exploration. We were going to eat in Rome for a day, and then head down to Naples to stay at his mother&apos;s apartment in the Vomero section of the city. We deplaned in Rome, rented a car, and headed to one of Rome&apos;s legendary pizzerias, Da Baffetto, recommended to me by many of the best Italian-influenced chefs in the U.S., including Mario Batali and Todd English. I wanted to try the place, but Maurizio disdained Roman-style pizza - that of the thin, crisp crust - and wanted to get to Naples. As he parked the car in a lot, he fired the first shot. &quot;If you ever had a choice and you ordered a Roman pie instead of a Neapolitan pie, I would say, &apos;You are sick.&apos;&quot; Keeping that in mind, we arrived at Da Baffetto, only to find that it was closed for lunch. A nearby shopkeeper told us the son of the owner of Da Baffetto had a pizzeria, Bel Paino, just around the corner, and he was open for lunch. We sat down and ordered a Margherita and a marinara. When they arrived at our table a few minutes later, Maurizio took one look at the ultrathin, crisp crusts and said, &quot;Take a good look at these, and remember what they look like and taste like. Never forget it. This is not pizza.&quot; I actually liked it but wasn&apos;t about to tell Maurizio that I thought the crust was crunchy and offered a nice counterpoint to the creamy melted mozzarella. We then hit two other Roman pizza variations: the pizza bianca (&quot;white&quot; pizza, with no tomato sauce) at Il Forno di Campo de&apos;Fiori (a crisp yet pliant flatbread made with sea salt and rosemary), and pizza by the meter at a bakery recommended by our friend, Italian food maven and food radio host Arthur Schwartz. I liked them both, but Maurizio dismissed each with a wave of his hand. &quot;You may like them, Ed, but they&apos;re nothing special.&quot; As we walked back to the car, I thought, &quot;Can it get any better than this? Four kinds of pizza - all of which I thought were pretty good - and I haven&apos;t even unpacked my bags.&quot;", "Around 50 kilometers from Naples, Maurizio started rhapsodizing about pizza in his native city. &quot;You put it in your mouth, and you go &apos;Wow! Now you have something&apos; - layers and layers of flavor coming at you in waves. Our pizza is like a souffl\ufffd, the dough is like a volcanic explosion in your mouth. Our pizza is like ... heaven.&quot; I looked over at him and realized that he&apos;d gotten so excited about the subject that his hands were completely off the steering wheel as he gesticulated for emphasis. I began to worry if we were even going to make it to Naples. We arrived at Maurizio&apos;s mother&apos;s house around 8 p.m. Rita, a tiny woman (and a legendary Neapolitan chef) with a warm smile and sunken, expressive eyes, asked if we were hungry. I was full, sickeningly full to be exact, but Maurizio suggested we have his local pizzeria deliver a couple of pies to begin our quest. &quot;It&apos;s not the best, but it&apos;s still better than anything you can get in New York.&quot; Maurizio&apos;s brother Bruno, a trained chef who cooked with his mother at DeRosa before moving back to Naples four years ago, called in the order. A half hour later, the pies arrived. The crusts were thicker than crackers and bready, and the toppings were reasonably sparse without being demure. The pizza had a lovely smoky flavor. The crust was not crisp, but that could have been the result of steaming in the delivery boxes. I liked it, more than my neighborhood slice place to be sure, but the pizza wasn&apos;t transcendent. I didn&apos;t dare tell Maurizio though, for fear he&apos;d send me back to New York on the next plane. I went to bed, full of Roman street food, Neapolitan pizza, and dread. The next day we started our pizza hunt at L&apos;Europeo, a trattoria and pizzeria located in a commercial district just off the water in one of the ancient parts of Naples. Before we made it to the restaurant, I tried a Neapolitan street pizza that I saw many people eating while they walked. The pizzas are sold from heated boxes in front of these trattorias, and they come right from wood-burning ovens. The one I got was fresh, doughy, and very tasty. Trying to fit in, I folded it in thirds, the way I had been told Neapolitans eat pizza on the go, and walked as I ate. Maurizio, Bruno, and I arrived at L&apos;Europeo, and Bruno alerted the owner to what I was doing. Alfonso Mattozzi was among the warmest and most gracious restaurateurs I have ever met or seen in action. He brought us two pizzas, a Margherita and a marinara, and they were not just good, they were astounding. The lip, what the Italians call the cornicione, was puffy and almost two inches high. The crust was light, ethereal and cloudlike. The San Marzano tomatoes were sweet, and the melted mozzarella di bufala was creamy and slightly tart. &quot;See, Ed,&quot; Bruno said with a wry smile, &quot;good pizza should melt in your mouth.&quot; As we talked about the pizza, pointing at its features, holding it up to get a better look at the crust, rolling our eyes at the flavor and texture, an elegant-looking man at an adjoining table chimed in. &quot;I have lived in Naples my entire life,&quot; he said, &quot;as have two generations of my family before me, and I can tell you that the pizza you are eating is one of the best in Naples, and therefore anywhere in the world.&quot; Mr. Mattozzi introduced this man, a Neapolitan shipping magnate named Mr. Grimaldi. He was dressed in a custom-tailored, three-piece suit, and had chosen to dine today on pizza from L&apos;Europeo. &quot;The great province of Naples has the longest and best pizza-making tradition in the world. But pizza is everywhere in Naples, so I am very careful about where and when I eat it. I&apos;m trying to think of ten pizzas I would finish here. There&apos;s here, maybe Lombardi, Ettori, Ciro a Margellina, Cafasso.&quot; He stopped, falling way short of ten. &quot;Even here, for a few months after Mr. Mattozzi lost his pizzaiolo, he went through four or five people, and the pizza was no good.&quot; Our discussion became quite heated and animated. Soon Mr. Mattozzi, his newfound pizzaiolo, and the restaurant&apos;s oyster shucker, a toothless elderly man dressed in a fisherman&apos;s sweater, joined in the discussion. Maurizio said, &quot;The frame [the crust] should have holes, like great bread. It should be thin in the center but not too thin. When you bite into it, it should melt in your mouth. All the elements should come together when you are in the hands of a great pizzaiolo.&quot; The oysterman waved his hand dismissively at Maurizio. Bruno translated with a chuckle: &quot;He says that you are talking about pizza as it were a work of art. Michelangelo was an artist. Now he had hands. This is just food. There is only one thing that makes things taste good: hunger. The best chef is hunger.&quot; It was obvious that Neapolitans care a great deal about pizza and could talk about it for hours on end, the same way New Yorkers could talk about pastrami, or Parisians about baguettes. The rest of the food at L&apos;Europeo was absolutely delicious: eggplant parmigiana made with smoked mozzarella that was nothing like the stuff we eat at American pizzerias; pasta with potatoes and basil and onions; focaccia with cured meats. Signore Mattozzi even had his pizzaiolo fry up some pizza dough just to illustrate how light it is. Sprinkled with powdered sugar, it tasted like the best zeppole I could imagine. It practically floated off the plate. Signore Mattozzi said, &quot;Put your finger on one of the holes. It will spring back.&quot; To illustrate, he put his knife on one of the holes and depressed it. It sprung back immediately. &quot;That is the sign of good Neapolitan pizza dough,&quot; said Maurizio. FIVE DAYS OF PIES Over the next five days, we went to just about every pizzeria that either Maurizio or Bruno knew to be good, fifteen in all. Our test pizzas were a Margherita and a marinara. Sometimes we would augment those two with a specialty. At Lombardi&apos;s, for example, we had a very fine pizza made with lard. We went to Da Michele, where they deviate from Neapolitan pizza orthodoxy by offering three sizes of pizza. It didn&apos;t matter. All three sizes tasted the same. We went to Brandi and ate pizza surrounded by Japanese and even a scattering of Americans. We went to Trianon and Lombardi&apos;s (Steingarten&apos;s favorite), Ciro a Mergellina, and 165-year-old Port&apos;Alba and Cafasso, an off-the-beaten-path spot that famed cookbook writer and Italian food expert Faith Willinger had recommended. And we went to Di Matteo, where President Clinton ate while attending the G7 economic summit in 1999. And guess what? The pizzas at virtually every place we went to tasted eerily similar. They all baked for less than two minutes in a 700\ufffdF, wood-burning oven. They all had a very high lip, at least two inches. The crusts were all slightly bready, with a taste-enhancing charred flavor. There wasn&apos;t a crisp crust in the lot. They all used locally sourced mozzarella, fior di latte, which not one pizzeria made on its own. Mozzarella di bufala was available upon request for a little extra money. The canned tomatoes were not drained, and this, combined with the rather large splash of oil (sometimes olive oil and sometimes sunflower seed oil) and the moisture given off by the cheese, made for wet pizzas that occasionally bordered on swampy. Although occasionally underbaked with a resulting gummy crust, the pizzas were all very tasty. But ... with the possible exception of the pizzas at L&apos;Europeo, none were exceptional enough to have me swearing off Pepe&apos;s or Sally&apos;s or Totonno&apos;s back in the States. On the second-to-last night, we ate at a bustling trattoria and pizzeria, Da Ettore. We had memorable pasta with langoustines and some very fine pizza with a crust that at least approached crispness. When Maurizio went to the bathroom, Bruno whispered, &quot;You see, Ed, there just isn&apos;t that much variation between pizzerias in Naples. The difference between the best and worst isn&apos;t all that great. In Naples, pizza is pizza. We are proud of it but, as you have seen, there are many places to get real Neapolitan pizza in Naples.&quot; On our last day in Naples, Maurizio and I went back to L&apos;Europeo. We had two pizzas: a Margherita and one with arugula and prosciutto. Both were fantastic: fresh tasting, yeasty crust, and not too wet. We also had fabulous fried zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta, incomparable foccacia topped with thin slices of pork belly that melted in our mouths, and the best pasta e fagiole (pasta with beans) I&apos;d ever had. We were taken care of with grace and charm by Mr. Mattozzi. I realized that I loved just about everything about Naplesits people, its sights, the foodeverything, that is, but the pizza. I couldn&apos;t bring myself to tell Maurizio. It would break his heart. So as we left Naples on the way to the Rome airport, I merely nodded when Maurizio said, &quot;Now you see, Ed, what I have been talking about all these years. Now I know you understand about our pizza. You are on your way to having a Neapolitan heart and soul.&quot; Pizza Margherita photograph from Ozchin; Pizzeria Brandi photograph from Scalleja.\ufffd"], "triple": ["Pizza", "be not invent in", "naples"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": null, "subject": null}, "_id": 4792}

This will not seem like a huge deal to people who don&apos;t dig science and technology maybe but even those who do most likely don&apos;t appreciate the findings of this little robot from the blue planet. I have written about the Phoenix before and it really is a marvel of human engineering and creativity. Check these facts. 1. The Phoenix lander approached Mars at 74,000 miles per hour. 2. The robot has traveled over 423 million miles in it&apos;s lifetime. 3. The Euro dudes orbiting Mars satellite, the Mars Express (yes the wankers really called it Mars Express) took this really cool photo of Phoenix landing. Imagine the math involved in catching that event? My brain hurts. In any event today the Phoenix Lander stopped sending signals. This is mainly due to the loss of power to it&apos;s batteries which was anticipated and scheduled. To say this was a success would be an understatement. For 200 million dollars, chump change in space bucks, we found water on another planet. For many in the scientific community that is the same as finding life all over the galaxy. The distances are so great that we may never meet them but the fact that water was present in the near past on another planet right in our neighborhood.... well that is just too many variables to be luck.

Content analysis was used to interpret responses (Brantlinger, Jimenez, Klingner, Pugach, &amp; Richardson, 2005). All of the answers provided by the 86 follow-up questionnaires were reviewed and classified by the researcher of this study together with the Shanghai teacher who did translation and back-translation for the S-TSE. Based on the experience of the researcher and the Shanghai cultural background of the teacher, it was apparent that some answers could be grouped under the same themes. The majority of the answers could be classified into the following three categories: respect or confidence placed in them by students and / or parents, the training they received from universities and the experience they gained from daily teaching practice. The above factors were the three most common answers given, however, some of the in-service teachers also provided other factors that just occurred once or twice from the 86 follow-up questionnaires and thus could not be classified into one of the above major factors. For example, &apos;it comes naturally&apos;, &apos;self encouragement&apos;, or &apos;commitment makes efficacy&apos;.

Ethanol is a fermentation product, primarily made from corn grain and sugarcane. Biodiesel is chemically-converted fat or oil. Ethanol is blended into gasoline. Biodiesel is blended into diesel fuel.", "I am an automotive instructor and started experimenting with biodiesel back in January as a response to my students. I have read many different articles and books on the subject. In my class we have performed many different experiments on tractors, cars, trucks and tractor trailers. We have heavy equipment program that allows us to \u201cborrow\u201d vehicles for experiments. I am currently driving a Mercedes on 100% biodiesel and have logged several thousand miles with the fuel. We modified the glow plug system and have cured 90% of the cold weather problems, unless it gets down into the low teens to single digit temps then either a blend of diesel fuel or plugging the vehicle in is the only way to get it to start. We are going to experiment with a thermal blanket this winter to \u201cstore\u201d engine heat around the fuel tank and see if that helps. I just wanted to put in my two cents. I think you are writing an excellent column. You are not being one sided. I don\u2019t think biodiesel will solve all our problems but I do think in the very near future it will help and it has started the ball rolling toward thinking of something besides petroleum as the \u201conly\u201d source of power. I feel that in the next 10 years automotive wise we will see the most diverse vehicle powertrains ever used. You may have gasoline while the guy next to you in traffic is using a pure electric and the guy next to him a hybrid and the lady behind him a hydrogen car and the one behind that using biodiesel. The ability to make these new hybrids and electrics as well as more efficient gas and diesel engines is still developing and is now being driven for the first time by an increase in consumer demand. I think the domestic car manufacturers have been blindsided and are behind in the race to produce these vehicles. It is kind of disappointing to see Toyota, Honda, and Nissan make such huge gains and have vehicles like the Prius and the Insight and Accord while the domestics don\u2019t have much to offer other than a few \u201cflexfuel\u201d vehicle options that may be cleaner but when using ethanol E85 and methanol M85 have terrible mileage.The cylinder canceling engines are pretty good though and the ones I have driven the switching off and on of cylinders is seamless.Honda is even going to offer a diesel for the 2008 production year.

Content is a function of purpose. Unfortunately many websites don&apos;t have a clearly thought-out realistic purpose; and orders alone, is not an adequate website objective. Obviously every company needs sales, that&apos;s a given, but sales are a result of all the marketing elements you put in place, and the degree to which your presentation distinguishes you from your competition. There is a prevailing view that traffic translates into sales; this viewpoint may be valid for websites whose economic model is commodity or advertising-based, but businesses that don&apos;t compete on price alone, or are more than an excuse to deliver advertising, must be structured around a purpose that is more meaningful, and far more compelling than &apos;give me an order or don&apos;t bother me.&apos; An over-emphasis on search engine friendly site design ignores the fact that when someone does a search for what you do, they&apos;ll not only find you, they&apos;ll also find many of your competitors as well. And even if you appear first in the search, nothing will stop potential clients from clicking on any of the other organic or advertised listings, or even the numerous Adword links on the side of the page. The biggest website design problem companies have is not the amount of traffic generated from search engines, but rather how visitors react to your content. Are visitors engaged, enlightened, and entertained so that they stay on your site long enough to get your marketing message, and is that message compelling enough for them to remember it? There are many misconceptions about advertising content, one of the biggest is that people hate it, but the truth is, what people hate is bad ad content; qualified clients actually look forward to good advertising because it presents a relevant problem, and provides a believable solution, in a distinctive memorable presentation. If your content doesn&apos;t engage your audience with a persuasive, memorable presentation then you&apos;ll never achieve whatever website marketing goals you&apos;ve set. How Should Content Be Delivered? We know the vast majority of people don&apos;t like to read text on a computer screen, so they scan for relevant information concentrating on bulleted points, captions, and headlines, but does that truncated information really get your message across? Website text is really designed for search engine spiders, which is fine, but how about paying a little attention to people and how they absorb and remember information? We also know people are impatient and are ready to abandon your website with the click of mouse, often in mid sentence before they ever get to the point you are trying to make. Your clients are sophisticated media consumers raised on video games and television, and are used to making quick decisions on limited information; this kind of leap-of-logic protocol demands a clever focused presentation. Your audience will be gone in seconds no matter how convincing you think your content is, if it is not presented in a media-savvy manner that holds viewer attention, otherwise your website is nothing more than a glorified Yellow Page ad. Audio and video has the potential to deliver information in a form and format that attracts and holds viewer interest while it makes a memorable impression. But even audio and video will fail if it is badly conceived, poorly written, and amateurishly performed. How Is Your Website Going To Be Marketed? Everyone is concerned with traffic and how to drive it to their websites. Search engine optimization is only one marketing technique, and it&apos;s one that ignores the impact of content on your audience in favor of attracting the attention of search engine robots. By all means, build search engine friendly elements into your site but don&apos;t ignore people-friendly elements as well. Having text-based articles on your site is an excellent way to provide search friendly information, but presenting that same information as a professionally produced audio option, or a lively video presentation is certainly more memorable. An entertaining webmedia presentation makes a lasting impression that viewers are more likely to recommend to colleagues, thereby increasing your traffic and reputation. Word-of-mouth is the best way to generate qualified traffic, and the best way to generate interest in your site is to make your site&apos;s presentation a rewarding experience. What Will Visitors Remember? In a brick-and-mortar environment, visitors are more likely to make a decision to purchase on the spot, simply to avoid driving halfway across town to save a few dollars, but on the Web jumping from New York to California is as easy as the click of a mouse. People are just more likely to shop-around because it&apos;s so easy. Of course what people think they want is the lowest pr&amp;iacute;ce, but providing the lowest pr&amp;iacute;ce only attracts the least profitable buyers and ignores the biggest obstacle website businesses need to overcome, and that&apos;s credibility. Who are you, and can you be trusted? And after visiting ten different websites all selling the same thing, can they even remember who you are? Your presentation has to be memorable and establish credibility so that when all the searching and browsing is finished, your site is the one they remember and go back to; your site must be the one visitors can trust to deliver what&apos;s promised. How to Hire A Web Video Firm The ability to produce an effective video or audio presentation requires more than the possession of some cool hardware and software. Owning an expensive camera doesn&apos;t make you a producer, and even the technical ability to edit doesn&apos;t qualify you as a commercial marketing expert. When the time comes to hire someone to add video and/or audio to your website what should you be looking for? Below are eight things you should consider when hiring someone to create webmedia. 1.

Internet is here to dominate our lives and spreading its tentacles very fast. Every month millions of pages are added to the web space and more and more people are getting online for almost everything ? from shopping to e-learning. Would you believe there are even online beggars with payment gateways where you can donate through your credit card if you are feeling charitable. If you do not exploit the internet for marketing your services or products you may as well be living in prehistoric times. While there are many ways to make money, web publishing is one of the most popular online businesses due to its suitability to internet as a least expensive online publication medium. E-publishing is tailor made for internet. Content is the key to web publishing. If you specialize in anything at all, and I think everyone does specialize in something, you could start your web publishing business and be up and running in hours. Web publishing could include: E-courses You can start a multi part e-mail course which your subscribers can pay for if you are in a highly specialized area. These courses could be offered either as stand alone subscriber only lessons through your website or offered free to promote your other e-publishing products which I have described here. You can write these courses of 200 to 300 words each lesson. Creating Special Reports While special reports are generally offered free to promote your services, you can sell your special reports if you are in exclusive niches. The special reports can be marketed for as low as $1. You only write it once and they can be downloaded from your site for long periods if you keep updating them. Just imagine if they are downloaded by 100 persons every week you pull in $4800 dollars a year for a few hours of work. Create CD&apos;s Your content can be transferred to CD&apos;s and marketed through offline as well as online channels. Your website could be the your shop taking orders and you can ship your orders as many people are still comfortable buying a tangible physical good rather than e-product. Start an e-zine This is still a very popular online business with multiple ways to generate income. You may offer a free e-zine within your niche and promote all other content based products. However it may take some time to create a large subscriber base and establish yourself. The key again is good content. Once your ezine becomes popular you can bring out paid subscription based editions. Write an e-book This is similar to the special reports. E-books would have more pages with extensive coverage of the chosen subject. Just look at amazon.com to find out how popular e-Books are.

In part one we covered the importance and tactics for choosing the keywords and keyword phrases that will provide the highest ROI for your optimization efforts. In part two we will discuss how to properly write content for high search engine positioning. Content is the key to search engine rankings. While there are numerous factors involved with the search engine algorithms, content remains a constant in stable rankings for a number of important reasons. Over this series we will cover the ten key aspects to a solid search engine positioning campaign. The Ten Steps We Will Go Through Are: Keyword Selection (http://www.beanstalk-inc.com/articles/search-engine-positioning/keywords.htm)", "Step Two ? The Importance Of Content There are many aspects of your content that are of key importance to your search engine rankings and for a variety of reasons. That said, they can be broken down into their three main benefits. The three main things you should be targeting with your content are: Unique and well-written. The search engine spiders are looking for unique content and your visitors are looking for well-written content. With articles come links. With quality content comes even more links. As long as you keep these three main purposes in mind while you are deciding what you want on your website and how it should be worded, you will fill this area nicely. Unique &amp; Well-Written Content The importance of unique and well written content cannot be overstated. This is the backbone and purpose of your website&apos;s existence and it deserves the time it will take to create. When you are considering what content you want on your site (or what content should be on your site if this is part of SEO or a redesign) you will want to make a few considerations. What does your audience want to find? Will you have to do additional research? Are you an expert writer or do you have one on staff? What Does Your Audience Want To Find? Assessing your potential visitors wants does not require a crystal ball. If you have completed and spent quality hours on Step One of this series, fully researching your keywords, you are already well on your way. Delving into those keywords you will often find hints that will push you in the right direction. If you have an acne site and you have found a number of people searching for &quot;acne treatment&quot; and &quot;natural acne treatment&quot; and have thus chosen these as your targeted keyword phrases you already understand your visitors current situation and more importantly, their desire. Similarly, if you are a real estate agent and have chosen &quot;los angeles real estate&quot; as your phrase you know more than simply characters strung together and dropped into a search box. You know that you are dealing with people wishing to purchase or sell a home in Los Angeles. In both scenarios you know what your visitors want and, assuming you are already successful in your industry, you know what you have to do to convert that desire into a client. Now what has to be done is to create solid, compelling content that will both grab your visitor&apos;s attention and at the same time, make them want what you have to offer. This is not the same as selling to them when you have the opportunity to speak to them face-to-face. You are working without the benefit of watching their expressions, speaking to them about their objections, or even understanding whether they are looking for information for a friend or if it is they themselves who require your services. This leaves you with a lot of room for content. In the online environment you have to deal with every question before they ask it, and make every person feel that you can help them even though you&apos;ve never met. What does your audience want to find? They want to find a solution to their problem. How do you provide that? By supplying them answers to the questions that they don&apos;t have the opportunity to ask and may not want to give you their email address to find out. FAQ pages are good but often used as sales pages, which is fine so long as you are still providing good content that your visitor isn&apos;t reading as &quot;sales&quot; but rather &quot;solutions&quot;. Perhaps create pages of replies to emails you have received. Perhaps place a related &quot;fact of the day&quot; on your homepage with a link to an archive of facts related to your industry, product and/or business. You might even want to add a blog to your site. Regardless, give your visitor the answers they&apos;re looking for and keep this information updated as you get new information and you will stand a much better chance of keeping that person surfing through your website. The longer you can keep them on your site, the greater the chance that you will build trust and once you&apos;ve got that, you can help them with the solution to their problem. Will you have to do additional research? For many business owners the gut instinct to this question is&quot;no&quot;. Of course not, you are an expert right? Well you may be, and so is Professor Stephen Hawking (http://www.hawking.org.uk/home/hindex.html), however my bet would be he still does his research. No matter how much you know there is always more out there and your visitors are probably well aware of that. If you fail to address all their questions, your visitors may very well leave your site in search of the answer. Once they&apos;ve left your site it becomes other webmasters who now have the opportunity to present the benefits of their products or services. Find all the information that you can and make sure that you include as much as possible on your site. The additional benefit in doing this is that constant new information on your website will not only keep visitors coming back to find new information but the search engines spiders too. If your site changes often the spiders will pick up on this and will visit you more often. While this by itself will not improve your rankings it does give you an advantage. The more often search engine spiders visit your website the faster changes you make will be picked up. The faster these changes are picked up the quicker you will be able to react to drops in rankings. If you know the spiders visit your site every second day and you drop from #8 to #12 you know that with proper tweaking to your content you may be able to recover that loss in as little as two days. Are you an expert writer or do you have one on staff? When you need a doctor do you read a book entitled &quot;Heart Surgery For Dummies&quot; and buy yourself a very sharp knife. Of course you don&apos;t and while your website may not be quite as important as your heart, it is how your company is being perceived online. This perception can be the make-or-break of all your online marketing efforts. If you are committed to attaining high rankings, to making money online and/or promoting your business through your website, shouldn&apos;t you also be committed to insuring that your conversions are maximized. High search engine positioning is important but so too is converting those visitors once they get to your site. You may be an expert in your field but if that field isn&apos;t writing, and you don&apos;t have a writer on staff, be certain to at least consider hiring one to make sure that your website is conveying the message you want in verbiage that your visitors will understand. Assuming you choose your writer well you will not only have a well-written site but you will also gain the advantage of having an outsider, who is more likely to write for people who aren&apos;t experts, creating your content. If you feel that you are qualified to write your own content (which you may very well be) be sure to have it proofread by someone from the outside. Find someone (ideally plural) from within your target market and demographic, and have them go through your content giving suggestions and criticism. Don&apos;t take it personally, every change they recommend is earning you extra money. Whether you implement the changes or not you are learning something new about what people will want and expect to see on your site. With Articles Come Links Writing content is not just an exercise for your own website. We all know that inbound links to your site help rankings. Additionally, if those links can be ones that provide genuine targeted traffic you&apos;re doing very well. There are a number of methods for driving traffic to your site with paid advertising, PPC, etc. however one of the most cost-effective methods is to publish articles. Article writing is no simple task however the rewards can be enormous. Articles server two great purposes: Increased Link Popularity ? When you write an article and submit it to other website to post, they will generally link to your website from the page the article is on. Here&apos;s a completely legitimate, relevant, and quality link to your site. Exposure &amp; Credibility ? The added credibility that article writing lends to your business coupled with the added benefit of the visitors who come to your site directly from your article are invaluable. When it comes to article writing there is little in the way of more effective advertising. You will have to find sources to publish those articles on, but once you&apos;ve done this time-consuming task you can reuse the same list for future articles. Get those articles on a number of quality resource sites and enjoy watching your stats and your rankings improve. With Quality Content Comes Even More Links Yet another benefit that derives from having a website with great content and writing articles is that, with time, your website itself will become a resource. If you provide great information that other people will find useful people will link to it naturally. With so much emphasis in recent times on reciprocal linking some might think this is the only way to get links at all. Believe it or not there are still webmasters out there who will link to sites for no other reason than they feel their visitors will be interested in it&apos;s content. Build a good site with quality content, keep it easily navigated and create sections for specific areas (articles for example) and you will find that people will link to your site and may even link to specific articles or your articles index. Perhaps then your articles index is a good page to target an additional keyword phrase. Next Week Next week in part three we will be covering site structure and the importance it plays in your rankings and in visitor experience. This will cover getting a spider through your site while also giving your visitors an easy path to the pages you want them on.

Housley Category: Podcasting Many people assume that podcasting is all about audio and fail to acknowledge the writing behind the show. Skilled communicators understand the type of planning required in order to pull off a clean final product. The most memorable and effective podcasts are always well planned. Some of the best podcast shows use a script and follow a structured format. The preparation that occurs behind-the-scenes is similar to what would take place for a radio show. Search Engine Optimization Resolutions Expert Author: S. Housley Category: SE Optimization Search engine optimization is a process, one that must always be revisited and adapted as search algorithms are changed by the search engines. Because SEO is a constant process, it is often pushed to the bottom of the &quot;to do list&quot; of marketers. Be that as it may, resolve not to ignore search engine optimization as it cycles its way through your task list. Give search engine optimization the attention that it deserves. Reflections for 2008, Predictions for 2009 Expert Author: S. Housley Category: Internet Marketing 2008 was a year filled with great triumphs and a year scarred by deep sorrow. What 2008 was not, was a peaceful year, and whether the world is a better place, for having endured is unclear. When Requesting Links Expert Author: S. Housley Category: Link Popularity Link building is an important aspect of search engine optimization. Search engines view a link as a vote of confidence in a website or webpage. The more links from related sources the greater the webpage&apos;s importance. When requesting links, use an email template that can be easily customized for specific requests. To locate prospective link partners, search Google or Yahoo for related keywords or phrases. Logo Concepts Expert Author: S. Housley Category: Internet Marketing A logo concept is more than just an affinity for a specific character. Logos represent a company&apos;s brand, and as a result, serious thought and consideration should be put into your logo. Before hand be sure to consider, how the logo will represent your organization and consider the thoughts that will be associated with specific images that you consider for your logo. Does the logo embody traits that can or should be associated with your business? Directory Submissions That Matter Expert Author: S. Housley Category: Website Promotion Links from different directories have different values. A webmaster&apos;s time is limited, and most webmasters want to get the biggest bang for their bucks. So where should they start when it comes to directory submissions? Search engines assign value to links from the various directories differently, so how do you spend your time where it matters most? Four Kinds of Links Expert Author: S. Housley Category: Link Popularity Links are an important component in an online marketing campaign. Websites usually need a significant number of quality links to perform well in organic search rankings. Once upon a time, high-quality links were plentiful. But with the growth of the web, and an ever-increasing number of competing websites, garnering link love and attention is a time-consuming and tedious process. Staying Ahead of the Competition Expert Author: S. Housley Category: Internet Marketing Staying ahead of the competition can be an on-going struggle. While it is not healthy for a company to focus too much time and attention on the competition, it is important to stay abreast of what your competition is doing. When evaluating the competition, assess the industry giants and companies closest to your space. But be sure that you don&apos;t exclude the small companies in your assessments. Why You Should Use Web Templates Expert Author: S. Housley Category: Web Design Web templates expedite the process of setting up a new website. The idea behind a web template is that it will save time with the creative design and layout process. In the business world, time is money; hence, using templates can save money. It can be a challenge to find a web designer for hire, and quite often the designer&apos;s schedule will not always mesh with the needs of a small business. Reaping the Podcast Rewards Expert Author: S. Housley Category: Podcasting Getting started with podcasting is a relatively inexpensive venture. The equipment and software required for podcasting is inexpensive for a business contemplating podcasting as a new marketing and communication adventure. First things first - you will need to decide on the podcast&apos;s content and format. What types of content will the podcast show contain? How long will each broadcast be? How frequently will new podcasts be available? How Do You Overcome Google&apos;s Filters Expert Author: S. Housley Category: SE Marketing Google tends to not rank new domains. In an effort to deter spammers from generating new websites, Google has implemented filters for new websites, which means that it can be a challenge for a new website to rank in Google&apos;s organic search results until they are deemed trustworthy. Blog Posts That Get Attention Expert Author: S. Housley Category: Blogging Writing blog posts is not just about spewing forth content. The best blogs are well thought out, and contain provocative and interesting unique content. Follow the above steps to produce a relevant blog worth reading. Tips for Choosing a Domain Expert Author: S. Housley Category: Domain Names Choosing a domain is one of the first steps in establishing an online presence. Changing a domain after-the-fact can be time consuming, and can be harmful to search engine ranking, so it is best to get it right the first time around. Follow these simple steps to select a domain name that will represent your online brand... Value Ad - Made for AdSense Websites Expert Author: S. Housley Category: Affiliate Revenue There is nothing wrong with profiting from a website - commercialization on the web is big business. But there needs to be value that distinguishes a website from its competitors. Content should be designed for website visitors, not for advertisements or search engines. Ultimately, the long-term profitability of a the website will rely on the value of the content contained in the website. If the content lacks value, the website will likely be profitable for only a short amount of time. Avoid Duplicate Content Penalties Expert Author: S. Housley Category: Web Content Large search engines attempt to filter their search results by removing any results that duplicate the content of other search results.

European emission standards and preferential taxation have forced oil refineries to dramatically reduce the level of sulphur in diesel fuels. In contrast, the United States has long had &quot;dirtier&quot; diesel, although more stringent emission standards have been adopted with the transition to ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) starting in 2006 and becoming mandatory on June 1, 2010 (see also diesel exhaust). U.S. diesel fuel typically also has a lower cetane number (a measure of ignition quality) than European diesel, resulting in worse cold weather performance and some increase in emissions. High levels of sulphur in diesel are harmful for the environment. It prevents the use of catalytic diesel particulate filters to control diesel particulate emissions, as well as more advanced technologies, such as nitrogen oxide (NOx) adsorbers (still under development), to reduce emissions. However, lowering sulphur also reduces the lubricity of the fuel, meaning that additives must be put into the fuel to help lubricate engines. Biodiesel is an effective lubricant.", "Bad quality (high sulphur) diesel fuel has been used as a palladium extraction agent for the liquid-liquid extraction of this metal from nitric acid mixtures. This has been proposed as a means of separating the fission product palladium from PUREX raffinate which comes from used nuclear fuel. In this solvent extraction system the hydrocarbons of the diesel act as the diluent while the dialkyl sulfides act as the extractant. This extraction operates by a solvation mechanism. So far neither a pilot plant or full scale plant has been constructed to recover palladium, rhodium or ruthenium from nuclear wastes created by the use of nuclear fuel.[6]", "46. diesel fuel injection

These large glucose molecules are also known as polysaccharides which can be composed of various numbers of monosaccharides and disaccharides. Complex carbohydrates are polymers of simple sugars (monosaccharides) that are branched and may contain lipid or protein groups. The three types of complex carbohydrates of nutritional importance are fiber, starch, and glycogen. Fiber refers to foods, mostly from plants, that the human body can not break down. Dietary fiber can be classified as soluble or insoluble. Examples of dietary fiber include beans, oatmeal, and the skins of fruits and vegetables. Starch, primarily found in grains, cereals, breads, and pastas, is the major source of carbohydrate in the diet. It is the storage form of carbohydrates in plants, comparable to glycogen in humans. Glycogen, commonly known as animal starch, is a starch-like substance in the liver and muscle tissue that is changed to glucose when it is needed for muscular work and for liberating heat. Glycogen represents the body&apos;s carbohydrate stores. Glycogen is not counted as one of the complex carbohydrates in foods because it is not found in significant amounts in food.", "Complex carbohydrates are important for several reasons. Starch and glycogen represent energy sources for the body while fiber has strong links to disease prevention. Fiber is not a single substance, but represents a large group of different compounds with a variety of effects in the human body. However, all types of fiber are parts of plants that can not be digested by enzymes in the human intestinal tract.

Child abuse and health-related quality of life in adulthood. Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease 195(10): 797-804, 2007. (62 refs.) Past research has indicated that child abuse is related to mental and physical health conditions and that mental and physical health conditions are related to decreased health-related quality of life (HRQOL). However, little is known about the independent relationship between child abuse and HRQOL. For the current analysis, data were from the nationally representative Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study. Multiple linear regression analyses tested the relationships between child abuse and current HRQOL (SF-36) after adjusting for the effects of sociodemographic variables and numerous psychiatric disorders and physical health conditions. Neglect, psychological abuse, physical abuse, severe sexual abuse, and number of types of child abuse experienced were associated with reduced mental HRQOL. Psychological abuse, physical abuse, and number of types of child abuse experienced were associated with reduced physical HRQOL. Child abuse is an important determinant of HRQOL. The ability to successfully reduce the occurrence of child abuse or provide early intervention after child abuse occurs may help to improve HRQOL in the general population.
